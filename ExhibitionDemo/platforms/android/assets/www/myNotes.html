								<p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model accounts for the fact that the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large scale structure and Hubble's Law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated beyond where they are valid, there is a singularity. Modern measurements place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies.</p>

								<p>Despite the lack of action from Congress, organizers continue to push for progress on gun violence prevention. 

								As tragic acts of gun violence continue to plague communities across the country, last week, with several OFA volunteers in attendance, President Obama announced a series of common-sense executive actions that will help save lives.

								For those who attended the event at the White House, watching President Obama's announcement proved incredibly moving. Read some of their reactions.
